# Web-scrapping-using-python
This is a simple web scrapping project where I used python libraries requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape Goodreads - a website which lets users 
from across the world to rate and review books.

This repository has 2 files:
1. ipynb file with output displayed. It has lengthy html output. So, you may get a bit frustrated to scroll through that. I can't help it though.
2. py file with just commands. You can use this and execute on your own system and check out the output!

Thank you :)
